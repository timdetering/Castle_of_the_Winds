## Notes

### Redit: Castle of the Winds Source Code and contacting Rick Saada

> [Edit] Oh hey I got a response! He still has the original code and is even making casual attempts himself to modernize the code base.
>
> So about 20 years ago, a friend of mine asked for the source code to Castle of the Winds and Rick Saada sent it to him. My friend did not know how to read C code and asked me for help deciphering it. After clumsily sending me various snippets of code to read through, he eventually just sent me the full source to help him out. This source code ended up being part of the backup I made of the laptop I had at the time and laid dormant on a tape drive.
>
> After about a decade, I ran into some discussion boards on Castle of the Winds remakes, which got me digging through my backups and found I still had a copy of the source code. Which I used to help give some info on the internal workings of the game but kept the source to myself since there was no indication that Rick Saada wanted to make it public.
>
> Later, on the BYOND member pages I found someone left a note to my friend asking about the source code, saying he contacted Rick Saada through Facebook about it but got the response that he no longer had the source code to the game.
>
> I unfortunately do not have a Facebook account and don't know of any email I can use to contact Rick Saada. Is there anyone here that can contact him and see if this is legit? If he no longer has a copy of the source code I'd love to send it to him and it'd be great if he would make it public to better keep it alive. I've made a few attempts myself to build it but the code is pretty archaic and well I don't use windows anymore and stripping out the windows dependent code doesn't leave much left.
