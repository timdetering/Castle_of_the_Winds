This file is a quick summary of the changes from 1.0 to 1.1,
and of some of the new features that have been added.  Some
of the text below only applies to game two.

New Features:
1.	Game Difficulty:
	You can now set the difficulty of your game in the
	Character Creation dialog.  Choices are Easy, 
	Intermediate, Difficult, and Experts Only.  1.0 is
	Intermediate on this scale.  Harder games have more
	monsters and traps per level, fewer objects and less 
	money per level, and the stores pay you less for
	stuff you sell them.  It also takes more experience
	to go up in levels of experience at harder difficulty
	settings.

2.	Button Bar:
	The most common commands appear on the button bar for
	easy mouse access.  The spells you have on the
	spell menu are present here as well, so you have easy
	mouse access to them as well.  Right clicking on the
	buttons will tell you what they do (and the mana required
	for the spell if it's a spell button). Keyboard users 
	can turn off the button bar in the new Options dialog 
	accessable via File-Options.

3.	There are various new text popups that appear during the
	game.  If you are loading an existing game, it will mark
	the ones you would have seen by now as seen, so you can
	view them in the Review Story dialog.  The Review Story
	dialog also now has a button that takes you to the Background
	section of the help file, which many people were missing.

4.	There is now a Character Attributes dialog accessable off
	of the Character dialog.  This displays a simple listbox
	that tells you if you are levitating, detecting monsters,
	what you are currently resistant to (and how strongly), etc.

5.	Added a Rest Until Mana Restored command.  Before, both 'r' 
	and 'R' did Rest Until Healed.  Now 'r' is Rest Until Healed
	and 'R' is Rest Until Mana Restored.  Both of these commands are
	now interruptable via any keypress or mouse click.  Rest Until
	Mana Restored actually restores mana at double normal rate,
	(2 points per hour), although it only interrupts when you 
	get attacked, not when you first see a monster. It's more 
	like "sleep" than "rest".

6.	Added Esc support to dialogs that only had an OK button.  Also
	added Double Click support in Review Story, Select Object, and
	the Spellbook dialogs.

Feature Modifications:
1.	Moved the options into a dialog (File-Options) rather than on the
	menu.  Also made the Spell menu accessable in the inventory for
	easy casting of identifies and remove curses.

2.	Some of the special monsters, such as Hrungnir in game
	one, and the giant kings in game two, are now immune to
	sleep and polymorph.
	
3.	The parchment is now deleted after it's read.  Since the text
	is available in Review Story anyway, there was no need to keep
	it around.  If you load a 1.0 game and had the parchment it will
	be deleted.

4.	Gelatinous Globs now always have some treasure.

5.	Levitation is no longer total trap immunity.  Only gravity
	activated traps are effected (trapdoors, pits, etc).  Magic
	traps, such as Glyphs, will still go off even if you are 
	levitating!

6.	Enchanted packs can no longer be nested.  You can still put
	multiple enchanted packs in a normal container, you just cant
	put them inside each other. 

7.	Resist Fear and Resist Acid have been removed, as they aren't
	useful in the current game (but someday ;) .

8.	Selling wands/staves to the stores guarantees at least 2 charges
	will be restored unless it shatters.

9.	Clairvoyance now maps secret doors and traps.

10.	The levitate spell lasts longer now (15 minutes instead of 10).

11.	Saving now puts up a message in the description window, so
	it's obvious after a click on the save button that it worked.

Bug Fixes from 1.0:
1.	Fixed the occassional level corruption bug with 
	the Save Levels To Disk option.  If you had a spell
	pending on a monster (Haste/Slow/Sleep) when you left
	the level, the game would put up warning messages
	and then GP when you returned to that level.  This worked
	fine if the option was turned off.

	Note that the SLTD option is only really needed on
	low memory 286 boxes,  since even at the end of game two
	the saved levels will only take about 350-400K of global 
	memory. In 386 protect mode you might as well let 
	virtual memory swap to disk as needed. 

2.	Fixed adjacent fire/lightning/cold ball spells to
	pay attention to resist/vulnerability (they weren't)
	when calculating damage to the character.

3.	Fixed elemental attacks to correctly use vulnerability
	when calculating damage to the character (if you 
	were vulnerable to fire, then fire elemental 
	attacks did NO damage!).

4.	Fixed Scroll Room Onto Screen to work when going 
	up/down as well.
