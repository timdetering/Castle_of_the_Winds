                            CASTLE OF THE WINDS
                     For Microsoft Windows 3.0 or later

              By Rick Saada  *  Published by Epic MegaGames

 The challenge of Fantasy Role-Playing meets the quality of Microsoft Windows

   Epic MegaGames brings you Castle of the Winds,  a fantasy role playing game
created by Rick Saada.  Your quest begins with A Question of Vengeance, as you
try to discover the secret of your mysterious past, and why is has proven so
deadly to those you love.  It then continues with Lifthransir's Bane, as you
attempt to vanquish the dark forces of evil which plague the land and are
after your life!

   Set in the world of Norse mythology, this game has plenty of surprises.
Nearly a hundred unique monsters oppose your quest, and there are hundreds
of enchanted objects to aid you.  Castle of the Winds presents a new style of
adventure game. While the anchor points of the story remain the same, most of
the adventure is created anew every time you play, so the game can be enjoyed 
again and again.

   Fans of fantasy and adventure games will love this one.  With over three
years in development,  this game beats commercial Windows games hands down,
and extensive online help gets you off to a great start on your journey.
